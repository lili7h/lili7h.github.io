## Set up

> Help! Your friend has had their (100MB) USB drive encrypted with some sort of ransomware attack! The attacker is asking for ðŸ’¯ bitcoins to decrypt it!! Can you help? Your friend managed to get the encryption binary too.

We have been provided with two zip files:
- encryptorjLBXpK3gz.zip (4 KB)
- volumeC11m7Xo1Zb.zip (100 MB)

These two files inflate to the following:

- encryptor
```bash
$ file encryptor
encryptor: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=9ca7c655b313fe2d63bff9dc2805ad7f3b4d25ae, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped
```
- volume.bin
```bash
$ file volume.bin
volume.bin: data
```

We can safely assume that the `volume.bin` is a container file for the entire file-system that has been encrypted. Therefor if this was not encrypted and instead recognised by `file` as some form of boot sector or file-system, we would be able to mount it to a folder using the `mount` command and a `loop` device. Something like:
<br />
```bash
$ mkdir test_dir
$ sudo mount -o loop volume.bin test_dir/
```
<br />
For now, we are going to put this file aside and focus on the `encryptor` tool. As it is generally ill-advised to run tools that may encrypt your drives, let's do a bit of reverse engineering and binary analysis first to determine its danger rating. As the old proverb goes, 'everything is a ~~nail~~binary analysis when you have a ~~hammer~~`strings`'. 
<br />
```bash
$ strings encryptor

<br />
This alone is enough to tell us that it isn't going to auto-detect any drives on the system and go around encrypting them. Especially since it _says_ it only targets FAT volumes, of which I have none. Of course, I am still running in a disposable Kali VM, but I trust it enough to spin it up and see what we get.

Enter the path of the FAT volume to encrypt: volume.bin

[+] Successfully opened specified file for reading.
[+] The size of file to be encrypted is 104857600 bytes.
[+] Volume serial number successfully read.
[!] Requested file is not the expected volume target. Aborting.
```
<br />
Notice how I specified the `volume.bin` file as the target volume to encrypt? It seems that the `encryptor` is expecting files over mounted volumes, so we don't need to run around mounting the device first then specifying the particular `/dev/loopN` device it may be mounted against. This is good, it makes our life just a tiny bit easier. Also note how it does some form of validation against the volume and errors out - since it's reading the volume serial number, we can assume that its using something like the magic byte sequence in the file-system superblock to validate the target. Let's crack open the binary and see what we can work out.
<br />
You might have noticed when we ran `file` on the `extractor` earlier that it is a stripped binary, this only serves to slightly lengthen our reverse engineering process but ultimately will not hinder us much. We will use [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) to perform the disassembly and decompilation of the binary. First up, load up a new project and import the binary, then open it in the code viewer and analyse it when prompted, this lands us here:
<br />
![The code viewer landing page after we have analysed the binary.]({% link assets/posts/adfctf/ransom/ghidra-entry.png %})
<br />
Since this is a stripped binary (and likely optimised), the assembly isn't going to be that human readable, so lets identify the 'main' function of the program. All ELF (**E**xecutable **L**inking **F**ormat) binaries have an 'entrypoint' function, which is where the program begins _before_ calling the `main` function. Ghidra is always able to identify this 'entrypoint' function regardless of if the binary is stripped due to the fact its address in codespace is hardcoded into the ELF file header. We can use this `entry` function to identify the `main` function, as in a standard C program, the `main` function will be passed as an argument function pointer to the `__libc_start_main` function.
<br />
![The code viewer decompiling the entry function.]({% link assets/posts/adfctf/ransom/ghidra-libc-start-main.png %})
<br />
Here we can see a function that Ghidra has identified as `FUN_001014f9` is passed as an argument to `__libc_start_main`, so we can assume this is the main function. Ghidra will let us rename this function, so while we're here, lets rename it to `main`.
<br />

<br />
Now we are able to decompile the main function, which turns out to be about 120 lines of stripped C code, with the important bits being the following:
<br />
```c
  printf("Enter the path of the FAT volume to encrypt: ");
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00102246,local_188);
  putchar(10);
  local_240 = fopen(local_188,"rb");
  if (local_240 == (FILE *)0x0) {
    puts("[!] Unable to open specified file for reading. Aborting.");
    uVar2 = 0xffffffff;
  }
  else {
    puts("[+] Successfully opened specified file for reading.");
    iVar1 = stat(local_188,&local_228);
    if (iVar1 == 0) {
      printf("[+] The size of file to be encrypted is %ld bytes.\n",local_228.st_size);
      local_244 = 0x347726c9;
      fseek(local_240,0x27,0);
      sVar3 = fread(&local_248,4,1,local_240);
      if (sVar3 == 1) {
        puts("[+] Volume serial number successfully read.");
        if (local_244 == local_248) {
          puts("[+] Requested file is the expected volume target.");
          rewind(local_240);
          local_238 = malloc(local_228.st_size);
          sVar3 = fread(local_238,1,local_228.st_size,local_240);
          if (sVar3 == local_228.st_size) {
            puts("[+] Volume successfully read.");
            fclose(local_240);
            local_198 = 0x74b44da6d2c0fe2c;
            local_190 = 0x71528916c1391e5;
            FUN_00101321(local_118,0x10,&local_198);
            local_230 = malloc(local_228.st_size);
            FUN_001013eb(local_118,local_228.st_size,local_238,local_230);
            puts("[+] Volume data successfully encrypted in memory.");
            free(local_238);
            local_240 = fopen(local_188,"wb");
            if (local_240 == (FILE *)0x0) {
              puts("[!] Unable to open specified file for writing. Aborting.");
              free(local_230);
              uVar2 = 0xffffffff;
            }
            else {
              puts("[+] Successfully opened specified file for writing.");
              sVar3 = fwrite(local_230,1,local_228.st_size,local_240);
              if (sVar3 == local_228.st_size) {
                puts("[+] Encrypted volume successfully written.");
                free(local_230);
                fclose(local_240);
                puts("[+] Done.");
                uVar2 = 0;
              }

Now, as you probably very quickly decided, this is a nightmare to read and understand. Variables aren't named, the code isn't succint, there's no comments... And unfortunately the only way to really get around this is to spend the time analysing what the code is doing and renaming variables and functions until it's more readable. I will save you the effort and do it 'off camera'. After renaming, this is what it looks like:
<br />
```c
  printf("Enter the path of the FAT volume to encrypt: ");
  scanf(&"%s",input_buffer);
  putchar(10);

  f_status = fopen(input_buffer,"rb");
  if (f_status == (FILE *)0x0) {
    puts("[!] Unable to open specified file for reading. Aborting.");
    exit_code = 0xffffffff;
  }
  else {
    puts("[+] Successfully opened specified file for reading.");
    stat_status = stat(input_buffer,&stat_buffer);

    if (stat_status == 0) {
      printf("[+] The size of file to be encrypted is %ld bytes.\n",stat_buffer.st_size);

      magic_bytes = 0x347726c9;
      fseek(f_status,0x27,0);

      read_status = fread(&volume_identifier,4,1,f_status);
      if (read_status == 1) {
        puts("[+] Volume serial number successfully read.");

        if (magic_bytes == volume_identifier) {
          puts("[+] Requested file is the expected volume target.");

          rewind(f_status);
          plaintext_volume_buff = malloc(stat_buffer.st_size);

          read_status = fread(plaintext_volume_buff,1,stat_buffer.st_size,f_status);
          if (read_status == stat_buffer.st_size) {
            puts("[+] Volume successfully read.");
            fclose(f_status);

            key_password_1 = 0x74b44da6d2c0fe2c;
            key_password_2 = 0x71528916c1391e5;
            key_generator(key,0x10,&key_password_1); // <----- function of interest 1

            encrypted_volume_buff = malloc(stat_buffer.st_size);
            volume_encrypt(key,stat_buffer.st_size,plaintext_volume_buff,encrypted_volume_buff); // <----- function of interest 2

            puts("[+] Volume data successfully encrypted in memory.");
            free(plaintext_volume_buff);

            f_status = fopen(input_buffer,"wb");
            if (f_status == (FILE *)0x0) {
              puts("[!] Unable to open specified file for writing. Aborting.");
              free(encrypted_volume_buff);
              exit_code = 0xffffffff;
            }
            else {
              puts("[+] Successfully opened specified file for writing.");
              
              read_status = fwrite(encrypted_volume_buff,1,stat_buffer.st_size,f_status);
              if (read_status == stat_buffer.st_size) {
                puts("[+] Encrypted volume successfully written.");
                free(encrypted_volume_buff);
                fclose(f_status);
                puts("[+] Done.");
                exit_code = 0;
              }
``` 
<br />
Now this begins to make a bit more sense. If you notice the first 'function of interest', we have some sort of password based key derivation function (PBKDF), with a hardcoded password. This is wonderful news, as it means we now can reverse engineer the key, and given that a valid decryption operation exists and that its a symmetric encryption algorithm, we can decrypt the volume.
