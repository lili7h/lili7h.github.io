It's somewhat difficult to lay out a specific set of rules documenting the types of things to expect, so instead have a set of examples:

On this site, you might find posts about:
- An event Lilith just attended, or will be attending
- A blog-post or technical report style post about a challenge or problem Lilith just solved
- A brain dump on the current state of affairs for Lilith
- A fictional piece of writing
- Lilith's self-exploratory poetry

Basically: this is a place for Lilith to be selfish and self-centered and post things about _her_. I hope thats okay with you all ðŸ™ƒ
