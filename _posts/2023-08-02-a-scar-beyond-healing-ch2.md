When the Star Helix badges piled through the door, Halo hadn't moved. Kneeling on the bed, amongst the blood and feathers. Blood dripping from his body, joined by tears and sweat as he shivered. The burning abandon having left his body, leaving naught but a feverish chill. Amongst what he felt, he was overpowered most by the profound emptiness. 

The badges poured into the room, service weapons raised. A barbaric scene of feral brutality laid before them, and the paradoxically dead-still greater wolf in the midst of it. Knelt upon the bed, amongst the limbs and flesh discarded like scraps, was an image straight from children's horror novels. The midnight black greater wolf knelt with its claws upturned, staring at its hands as if it could learn the secrets of the universe from the course black pads ringing their centre. Blood, hot and bright red, dripped from its dark fur. The head of a wild beast, facing away from the door, but its snout, the snout of an animal. Dripping- turned ever so slightly towards the badges. The cast of Star Helix security members a mixed bag, some outwardly nervous at the idea of being cramped in such a small room with such a visibly unhinged apex-predator, others tamed by decades of dutiful service, all perplexed as the final streaks of angel white bled from the back of its arms, bottomless black taking its place.

A deep, bone-rattling shiver had set in by the time the {{ sec }} badges had fit over his head a muzzle big enough to contain his maw. They had been saying things, yelling things, but he had heard none of it. The white-noise in his head a fog, blinding his senses.
