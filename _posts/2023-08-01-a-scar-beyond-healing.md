It was a bright morning, the digital sun was warm and the air slightly cool. Halo meandered his way through the angled streets of the Spin Station with a skip in his step. He'd managed to get shore leave on {{ ssname }} early, as the Titan class battlecruiser '{{ ship }}' that he'd called home for the last few months detoured via Sol. With the soul-crushingly exhausting time he'd spent in CyOps onboard {{ ship }}, he'd had very little time to talk with his boyfriend. It had been several days even since their last message. 

His boyfriend... Halo day-dreamed. Zee was a smaller wolf, coming up around 5'5, sitting well below Halo's eye-line. His mottled grey-black pelt was soft and flowing, his blue eyes deep and emotional. To Halo, this was perfect. The way Zee's body slotted against his own, as if their figures were keyed to each other. The way Halo could wrap his arms around him and hold him tight and keep the whole world out. When they were together the world meant nothing to them. Even in the way Zee would wrap his thin arms around Halo's waist and stare up at him, with that dreamy look in his eyes and a love-drunk grin plastered across his maw- sometimes with just a peak of a 'blep' adorning his thin lips.

And Halo had the build and the drive to make sure no one or no-thing could take Zee's smile and youthful jubilance from him. At 6'6 and pure white, the luxuriously fluffy greater wolf had a primal sense of feral ferocity to his appearance - his claws longer and sharper, his body more streamlined, muscles more prominent, his ears nominally bigger and more sensitive, his teeth sharper, his mouth bigger, everything about him made to hunt and prey. Zee had often said that the least scary part about him were the deep cosmic purple eyes, the swirls and specs of colour a mystery that he could get lost in for hours.

Together, they split the difference between frightening and cute. Scary and huggable.

Halo rubbed at the back of his neck nervously. Ever since he'd been posted on the {{ ship }}, he'd noticed a small black patch of fur. Not dissimilar to the patches of grey or white that would occasionally show through in the more 'vintage' members of the {{ ship }}'s crew, except of course, pitch fucking black. Halo's pelt was gloriously white, almost glowing in the bright light of the simulated sun of {{ ssname }}. So it was obviously quite concerning to Halo (and his pride) for this vanta-black patch of fur to start pushing through. It had started just at the base of his skull, where the back of the neck meets the skull. Over the last few months it had slowly grown, slowly growing down his neck like an inverse teardrop, now covering almost the area of one of Zee's paws. Halo silently hoped that Zee wouldn't hate it, dreamed that he might know the cause, and therefore, the solution.  

Halo was going to surprise Zee with his early return! He'd walked into the job with all the qualifications and requirements that the Republic's Navy sought, and they had swept him away with little thought for how his first rotations would station him away from home, away from {{ ssname }}. It had been an emotional post-in departure, but one with many many promises. And Halo was back early to try and meet every single one of them.

It had been a little past 0600 when the {{ ship }} had docked at {{ ssname }}'s central spoke to take on supplies, and by the time Halo had managed to sign out and push his way to the outer residential layers, it was nearing 0830. Honestly, Halo wasn't even sure what day it was. He was hoping that it wasn't one of Zee's morning workdays, if his schedule was still the same after 6 months. Even if it was, maybe he'd be able to catch him, just for a moment on his way out the door.

Halo pounced up the stairs towards their third tier row house. The houses on {{ ssname }} were arranged in tiers, lining either side of a central thoroughfare, all looking in. 

*That's odd... Usually Zee is up by now...*

Halo had spied the front windows of their small unit, curtains still drawn, no light escaping from inside. Even Zee's running shoes were still sat airing by the front door mat. Not wanting to wake him immediately, Halo scavenged inside his heavy duffle for his house key, the NFC card triggering a soft beep when swept across the front door. Slowly Halo pushed his way in, taking note of the seemingly additional pairs of shoes that Zee had collected over the last 6 months, careful not to trip on them. Setting his bag down by the couch, Halo wondered through the lounge room towards their bedroom, through the rear hallway. It had been so long, the sight of Zee sleeping would be more than enough to fill him to bursting with happiness. Softly sliding the bedroom door open, Halo poked his head in.

And his heart dropped.

Zee laid on his chest, his arms under the pillow, back softly rising and sinking as his sleep-calmed lungs drew air in and out of his perfect body. The sheet having slipped down, revealing most of his grey-black mottled back, the shoulder blades intricately carving out sharp ridges through his fur. The crease of his spine arcing gracefully down his body, the lightly toned muscles playing in and amongst the carefully petite bone. Just a hint tail was visible under the sheet, precariously perched on top of the spot where tail meets spine, a small amount of soft fluffy wolf-butt visible.

This image wasn't the problem.

It was the feathered owl laying atop and aside of him. One of the owls brown, black and white feathered wings draped over Zee's shoulder. His beak nestled into Zee's neck, chin resting just atop Zee's other shoulder. And it was a He. That was no doubt. The owl  having fell asleep atop the covers, lack of clothes revealing some... impressive... assets, perched and clearly used, upon Halo and Zee's bed. Slowly Halo's periphery expanded, the details of the room becoming more obvious, noticed. Clothes strewn, condom wrappers. His Zee. His bed. His house. This... AVIAN had... taken... HIS Zee. Halo's blood was boiling- he had to leave. NOW.

The inky black fur on the back of his neck started to raise, his senses bristling. Small tendrils of inky black pushing across his fur. Thin vein-like lines wrapping his neck. Against his will he felt his lips drawing back, revealing a rich set of terribly gruesome teeth. His ears raised, his tail bristling directly behind him, almost parallel with the floor. He couldn't help it. His vision tinted red. This intruder had defiled his home. His life. His closest friend and ally. He couldn't help it. A low growl started to pour from Halo's gruesome snarl. Saliva dripping. His whole body felt hot. His claws, a desire to dip them red.

Zee stirred first, the low bass hum from behind him slowly raising him with a disturbing familiarity. Oh. The sleep drain from his veins, replaced with ice-cold dread. Mistake. He turned his head.

Blood.

Blood everywhere.

Followed closely by feathers.

The sky-hunter didn't get a chance to stir. To raise his wings.

There was teeth. Biting. Clamping. Tearing. 

Then the wings were gone.

The claws were next, gouging. Digging, slicing. Blood and feathers.

A scrambling leg fell limp, its tendons severed by the ruthlessly sharp wolf toe-claws digging into it. 

The greater wolf perched upon the owls back, drowning in red.

One last snap of its jaw. This time the neck. And the owl fell still.

The distant kicks and punches of a hysterical Zee barely an itch to the greater wolf. Its bloodlust and ravenous anger drowning out everything else. All other senses and feeling.

Blackness enveloped Halo. Blood pouring from his body to reveal the inky black underneath. 

What had he done?

He turned, letting Zee's ineffectual barrage continue.

The tears streaming down Zee's face. The distraught helplessness behind his eyes.

Halo broke.
