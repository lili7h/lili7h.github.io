Over time Lilith has struggled with many components of her physical, social and psychosocial worlds. Many times has she had so much fire and energy in her core that she couldn't capably deal with it. To an extent, writing is her primary outlet for things she feels but can't so clearly interpret in a physical sense.

This means that her writing is often jumbled, rushed, messy and, usually, depressing. 

Does this mean she is depressed? No, not necessarily. Putting the words here gives her an outlet, so that those ideas don't continue to poison her mind. We all have a darker, repressed side, Lilith has just given up trying to hide hers.

Lilith takes great inspiration from a lot of writers, some of her more favourite being NSFW writers, such as Stratothrax and l0n3rsart. Particularly, Stratothrax's 'Dreadwolf' has inspired Lilith greatly.

Over time, Lilith will adapt her writing style and find her niche. Until then, please hold tight <3.
