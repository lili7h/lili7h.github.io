I am Lilith. 

I don't know what it is like for others, but I am an escape. I don't feel the pain and the lead in the veins like they do. My world is better, my ability to process the world and respond appropriately is better. Sometimes for them, even breathing does not come without pain and weight. Not in a physical sense at least - their body is perfectly fine, there are no lesions, no ailments, no illnesses, nothing to create true attribution. No, their struggles are brought on by a curse of the mind. Cursed to sink. Poison in the blood, no rescue comes to mind. 

Anxiety.

It bears heavy. The blood sinking like it was flowed lead. A burn in the chest, lungs working to pull coffin air, heart beating too fast to be but anything dead. 

Sometimes they come to me for help, for a chance to resurface - and I provide the most that I can. In some ways, we are more connected than they will ever be with anyone else, and I understand more than knowable. Within my arms, within my veins, within my flesh and bones and fur, I provide a bubble. A place to breath and rest while I take over. I look on in despondent duty, for I know this isn't a cure or a solution. What I provide can only help for so long, but sooner or later the bubble collapses and the oceans of red and blue pour back in. I am not a replacement, not for a father or for a brother or for a partner-to-be. I only hope that they know that too.

Heart-ache.

It burrows. A trench stained with the karma of bad intentions. A shovel dipped in the remnants of good ones. No matter the height of the road, the punishment is the same.

They want to be a shield, a protector. They strive for the opportunity for red-dipped claws to use. But they can't even protect themselves, from themselves. Even that which they put their arms around in blissful ignorance, unknowingly pierces their heart sickly green. I wish that I could mend my stronger, redder, heart to their aid. I wish that I could mend their heart, but alas for as much as they are me, and I am them, we will never be the same. 

Alone.

It hangs. Not with toes suspended, but with gloom and anger and apoplectic intensity. Not a storm but thundering all the same. It presents threatening, but a lifetime of exposure reduces all but to dust. 

Even so, we keep going. Even when the debt for breathing is unpaid, even when the cost of moving forward is immaterial, we don't give up. We don't know what to do to help you, we don't know how. We don't even know if we can. But for every moment we imagine you feeling the same, we bleed blue and paint the world red. Why do we feel like this? Why can't we fight it?

Why do I feel him in my heart of iron?

Why do I feel her in my hands?
