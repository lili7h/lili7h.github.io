# About

Hello! I am Lilith, a rogue wolf-with-horns on the internet!

I also have two other adopted fursona's! 

I am a technofurry in the tech industry, and I like programmin', linux, system administration and home labs!

My dream car right now is a GR86 GTS.

<i>...EDM, Metal, DNB, Rap...</i>

This website is built using Jekyll, GitHub Pages and the `Cvless` Jekyll template. You can find more information regarding this on Lilith's GitHub.

# Did you meet me?

If you found this website via NFC, then congratulations! You are one of a very small number who have. How cool! 
Otherwise, welcome to my website. This website acts as a sort of hub world for all of Lilith's medias and content. 
There will also be the occasional story time, journal entry, or rambling post from me here.

If you met me in VRChat or at a Con, shoot me a message on Telegram or Discord with the [appropriate information]({% link found_me.md %}) so I can add you to the wall here!
