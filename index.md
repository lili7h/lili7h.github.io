# About

Hello! I am Lilith, a rogue wolf on the internet who loves to refer to themselves in the third person. Professionally, Lilith is in the Cybersecurity industry, and is an experienced software developer. Lilith likes to nerd out over C, Java, JavaScript, Rust, Ruby, Python and even more niche things like Jekyll, Liquid, ARM/MIPS/x86 ASM, CUDA, MPI, OpenMP, Operating Systems Implementation and much more.

Lilith is currently engaged in the [MegaAntiCheat](https://github.com/MegaAntiCheat) project, managed by [megascatterbomb](https://www.youtube.com/c/megascatterbomb). You can also find information on the project and others like it by visiting mega's Discord server or [website](https://megascatterbomb.com/). Lilith's other current projects cannot be discussed publically.

Lilith's icon and artwork (which adorn this page) were created by the incredibly talented `@sir_lorart` on Twitter (No she will not be calling it X), and Lilith's fursuit components are a mix of the equally incredible artists over at [Twisted]({{ site.fursuit_makers.twisted }}) and herself.

This website is built using Jekyll, GitHub Pages and the `Cvless` Jekyll template. You can find more information regarding this on Lilith's GitHub.

# Did you meet me?

If you found this website via NFC, then congratulations! You are one of a very small number who have. How cool! 
Otherwise, welcome to my website. This website acts as a sort of hub world for all of Lilith's medias and content. 
There will also be the occasional story time, journal entry, or rambling post from me here.

If you met me in VRChat or at a Con, shoot me a message on Telegram or Discord with the [appropriate information]({% link found_me.md %}) so I can add you to the wall here!
